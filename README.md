# Bundle Compressed B-Tree
Bundle Compressed B-Tree (BCB-tree) is a data structure proposed by [Tao Yufei](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~taoyf/) in his [publication](/pods11-agg.pdf). This is the C implementation of BCB-tree solving the range count problem. Visualize by using GTK+.

# Instruction
To compile bcbtree_range_count under Linux:

1. Get gtk+:

	```
	sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
	```	
2. Go to bcbtree_range-count directory and make

	```
	make clean;make
	```	
3. Run
	
	```
	./range_count
	```
4. Started and have fun!
